É inútil e portanto o pior dos podelos. ALT-R tem informação em excesso e não explicita os subtipos das entidades, causando mais confusão do que esclarecimento. ALT-P e ALT-Q omitem diferentes aspectos, mas ALT-P sinaliza relações inexistentes no modelo completo, como a ligação direta entre carro e motorista.ALT-Q poderia omitir alguns itens desnecessários, mas é o que mais se aproxima de um resumo do modelo original."
