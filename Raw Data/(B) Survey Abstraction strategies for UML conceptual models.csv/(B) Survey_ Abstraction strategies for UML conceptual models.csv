Other models are either too simplistic (ALT-K), and do not provide the reader with a good understanding of the domain, or contain too much information extending beyond the specific problem domain. However, the latter are more complete and relate the problem domain to more general patterns that are however necessary to developing the resulting information system."

ALT-L is the most easier to understand - it holds the cardinal entities of the complete model in a way that it is very easy to understand. Furthermore this abstraction encodes types of entities as relations (for instance - a driver) this allows faster traversal of the graph for analytics proposes. The tradeoff is that this abstraction allows unrealistic behaviors as a person that is marriage to himself, etc. 
The rest of the models missed the correct focus according to my understanding (ALT-M on insurance aspects, and ALT-N on the car rental agreement)    "
