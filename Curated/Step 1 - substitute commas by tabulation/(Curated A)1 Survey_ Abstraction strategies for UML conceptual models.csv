A few notes, among others: (1) in general I prefer a consistent notation for associations. Right now, uni-directional navigation is indicated explicitly for some association ends (with an arrow), whereas for others it is not, and importantly: it is not clear why this navigation is indicated; (2) while I prefer alt-C, the model may be improved by the use of attributes, especially to make clear the identity of subclasses car needing repair, car needing maintenance (due to the association functional car at least has a clear own identity). (3) also in alt C both the superclass organization and its subclass car rental have an association, but due to a lacking (of roles), apart from the minor difference re uni directional navigation  I do not know what is the distinction between these associations."

The original model should be improved. For example, when there is (and there are many) an ""association class"" A that reifies an association between classes B and C, the associations between A and B and A and C are implicit and should NOT be shown in the diagram. Also, only the name of the association class and the role names of the participants B and C  should be shown  (not the name of the association).
Some subtypes are artificial (and perhaps incorrect). For example, SenderBranch and Receiver Branch. They should be role names of the two associations between ThansferAgreement and Branch.
