O modelo ALT-Z também é bem completo, mas devido à opção por usar enumerações para representar muitos atributos, acaba por deixar o modelo mais poluído, exigindo mais atenção para entender as suas representações. 
Escolhi a modelagem ALT-Y como a pior representação pois ela é excessivamente simples, omitindo muitos detalhes importantes que inviabilizam o entendimento global da regra de negócio para uma pessoa não familiarizada com a mesma. Ela seria uma boa representação alternativa para uma equipe que já domina a regra de negócio ter uma visão rápida da mesma, mas seria muito ruim para um primeiro contato com essa regra de negócio."

It makes the gist clearer, that everything else revolves around relationships between these 3 main concepts - Person, Org and Car (I'm considering the fourth, website, redundant and unnecessary to understand the gist). Everything else is just qualifying these or are relationships between them. Transfer agreement being the only reified relationship also highlights its importance.

ALT-Y is just the worst because it says too little, it doesn't have enough detail. This model is about car rental, which is not addressed, it does not convey the gist.

Between ALT-X and ALT-W, it's a tough call. ALT-X is polluted, has a lot of concepts that seemly offer no benefit to understanding the gist (are redundant). However it seems to me that the fact that people are insurable items is very relevant and is not conveyed in ALT-W. The model arrangement is harder to read too. These two factors make me decide ALT-X is better than ALT-W
